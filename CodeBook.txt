Wearable Computer Data Project Codebook

Each variable will have certain characteristics to it's label, below is how many of the variables will be broken down:

	[Time/Frequency]_[Body/Gravity]_[Accelerometer/Gyrometer]_[Mean/Standard_Deviation]_Function_Results_[X/Y/Z]_Axis

Each section below contains the variables for each subsection ([]) of the variable label above
	[Time/Frequency]
		-Denotes whether the variable is covering time or frequency
	[Body/Gravity]
		-Denotes whether the measurement was observin body movement or gravitational effect
	[Accelereometer/Gyrometer]
		-Describes whether the device's accelereometer or gyroscope recorded the observation
		-This subsection can also contain Jerk signals or Magnitude, denoted by Jerk or Mag
	[Mean/Standard_Deviation]
		-States function uses in the observation
	[X/Y/Z]
		-Displays axis the observation was taken

Subject
	-An integer numbered 1 - 30. Used to signify the subject id of the subject whose data was recorded

Activity
	-String, will contain one of 6 values:
		-Walking
		-Walking_Upstairs
		-Walking_Downstairs
		-Sitting
		-Standing
		-Laying
	Used to determine activity to data recorded.
