# WearableComputer Data Project
This repository will cover the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. This data will contain a collection of variables from the UCI Human Activity Study.  In  particular, this project will look into certain aspects of the data given, notably the means and standard deviations of the recordings. The recordings cover the accelerometer and gyroscope of a Samsung Galaxy II Smartphone attached to the waist of 30 subjects. The accelerometer and gyroscope created records for specific actions such as movement of the individual during a certain task.


##Desired Outcome
When completed, this data will contain each recorded actions mean and standard deviation, grouped by Axis in some cases, along with the activity performed and the subject it was performed by. This aspect should be able to be used to determine correlation between an activity and the readings of the Accelerometer and Gyroscope.
